<div class="wikidoc"><h1><b>History Background and Inspiration to Ntleas</b></h1>Ntlea is another location emulator program written by <i>LoveHina Advance</i> (<i>AVC</i> in short) and <i>magami</i>(NtleaGUI), like Microsoft&#39;s Applocale, mainly for running applications without requiring user to switch Locale explicitly, in early 2008.<br /><br />While the author <i>AVC</i> is busy working, and ntlea core stopped maintaining support Windows 8 and 8.1, and sadly, ntlea will be no longer taking effect any more.<br /><br />Ntlea uses Win32 API Low Level Hooking, and it is developped using Assembly code, the loader is coding using MASM, and the core Hook DLL is using GoASM Assembler. These 2 prevent many people who wanna do continue work on Ntlea.<br /><br />Though there are some other choices instead, like <a href="http://kdays.cn/days/read.php?tid=182">Locale Switch</a>, <a href="http://i.watashi.me/archives/locale-emulator.html">Locale Emulator</a>(<a href="https://ntlea.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=https%3a%2f%2fgithub.com%2fxupefei%2fLocale-Emulator&referringTitle=Inspiration">src</a>), or even MS apploc, ntlea had its own features : 
<ol><li>Small Executable size, fully opensource, simple hook method, direct source code(though asm);</li>
<li>The only 1 known which is Compatible with Portable softwares(Maybe none kernel hooking system);</li>
<li>Still lots of users knowing it and/or currently using it;</li>
<li>support from Windows XP, which would be supported by M$ until 2015.7.14;</li></ol>
and: 
<ul><li>If ntlea could running on windows 8/8.1, that must be wonderful!</li>
<li>If ntlea could change fully or mostly using C source code, many developers may contribute on it more easily, being truely OpenSource Program!</li></ul>
After about 2 months work and test in my spare time on studying Ntlea hook tech between ASM and MSVC, I found it is possible to rewrite Ntlea with C source code(or say, only less than 1% code is Assembly)<br /><br />considering that Win2000 and WinXP-SP1 were no longer most people to use, ntleas dropped those supports (actually, all code was there and had been translated to C, but haven&#39;t test them), transcode on XP-SP2/XP-SP3 will be continue supported, though whole XP will be discontinue supported by Microsoft.<br /><br />Above all are the main inspirations/goals of rewriting ntlea to ntleas, with author&#39;s helping and my friends tests, and new one ntlea ... <br />Finally Ntleas is now here !!<br /></div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
