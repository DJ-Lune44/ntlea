<h1><strong>Ntlea is</strong></h1>
<p>A Windows NT series Locale Emualtor Software Originated by <em>LoveHina Advance</em>. It is fast, small size, full open source as assembly code, with customize and no other dependency utility. Now it is in history. While&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>Ntleas is</strong></h1>
<p>A fully rewrite using C source instead of original assembly source, named as the successor of its senior,
<em>inherited&nbsp;all input parameters as ntlea</em>. with some <strong>new features</strong> below:</p>

<li>Support From WinXP-SP2 to Current Windows 10（including: XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10） </li><li>Support Random BaseAddress Application Hook,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Some special non-standard Window Message Handling Hook (while ntlea may crash there)
</li><li>Support a lot of RMXP/RMVX applications, and&nbsp;more compatible under X64 system to run X86 applications
</li><li>Support Hook TabCtrl Message-Handler, to fix garbled-strings special in windows 8 / 8.1
</li></ul>
<p>and will be more ... See <a href="/wikipage?title=changelogs&referringTitle=Home">
Change Logs</a> to find more informations on recent changes or news.</p>
<hr>
<p>Thanks to everyone gave us help, and ntleas will also be <strong>open source</strong> as its senior ntlea, just after the application approaches more stable, see
<a href="https://ntlea.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Open%20Source%20Status">This Planning</a>, hope you could support it and us :D</p>
<h2><strong>Donations</strong></h2>
<p>Donations are greatly appreciated. If you find Ntleas useful, or are otherwise just of the generous nature, and would like to make a donation to this project, Paypal is not accepted currently from PAYPAL warning :(.</p>
<p>I'll be continue to find another way ;)</p>
<h2><strong>Thanks to&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Chi Zhang,&nbsp;Hongyang Hui,&nbsp;sittipod wonjalond,&nbsp;Zeng XuSheng (with time order ;), we will continue our works on ntlea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Contributions</strong></h2>
<p>Currently, our main targets are :&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Testing more games / applications for stability</strong>. Submit errors as issues, we'll do our best to dig in it and try fixing it. Please, don't just tell us a simple error description, we suggest you to follow&nbsp;<a href="https://ntlea.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=feedback&refereingTitle=Home">How
 to Feedback</a>. </li><li>Original NtleaGUI was also no longer maintained, <strong>a new GUI should&nbsp;be required.
</strong>Currently, <em>popcade</em> helped me built <a href="http://trxq.cn/read.php?tid=112&fid=17">
a simple util</a>, thanks a lot :D. </li><li><strong>Find some methods Hooking for avoiding system Dependency. </strong>With Windows System Upgrade, Current method of Hooking on each function would have to be rechecked, that's dummy and trival things.
</li><li><strong>Support native X64 application if possible</strong>, &nbsp;maybe changed its dependency on mhook or still use X64 version manually( but MSVC is not support x64 inline assembly). And more, maybe considerate compiling through MSYS/MINGW/GCC.
</li></ol>
<p>The Author <em>AVC</em> also pointed out that hooking, which is currently main &amp; simple method is not very good method to location emulate, he did have done
<a href="https://github.com/av233max/NTLER">another&nbsp;new method on sys driver</a>. Is there any new method to lead location-emu??</p>
<p><em>AVC </em>also told me that LE is using some more latest hook techniques than ntlea, but what's new? So the main reason I took a lil time to learn the techniques of Locale Emualtor were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Why Locale Emulator could do more accurate translation on many VCL like customized controls than ntlea(s).
</li><li>Why Locale Emulator could not be used inside spoon and something like portable softwares.
</li></ol>
<p>But the result was yet not very successful,<a href="https://github.com/AsunaYuuki/Arianrhod/tree/master/Source/LocaleEmulator2/LocaleEmulator"> cuz of partial source
</a>(many sources missing there), and I could only guess its methods &amp; tricks,
<a href="https://ntlea.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=LEResearch">here will be my simple Notes</a>.</p>
<p>If you have interesting helping or joining, send us a message or leave us a feedback! And if you want to help but don't know how to or have no time, tell your friends about new ntlea, he / she may be just in trouble and needs&nbsp;it.</p>

<h1><strong>More About Ntleas</strong></h1>
<p>Ntleas was begin at 2013.11, with translation to C&nbsp;and bug fixed in 2 months. The First Public Beta Release was at 2014.1.30, the last day of Chinese-Year ; )</p>
<h2><strong>Background &amp; Motivations</strong></h2>
<p>There already were Applocale, Location Emulator and Location Switch!, why Ntlea still should be rewrite, see
<a href="https://ntlea.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Inspiration">this inspiration</a>. Ntleas is and will be just another choice among all Locale Emulators.</p>
