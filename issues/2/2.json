    "Description": "Some KAG games apparently don't handle drive/folder paths correctly under NTLEA, when  configured .cf file is present in the same folder.\r\n\r\nThey report error on launch:\r\n\r\nexe_name\r\n---\r\n\"\" は対応していないメディアタイプです.\r\n---\r\n[OK]\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf there is no exe_name.cf file in the same folder, or if it's empty, the game runs fine.\r\n\r\nTested on games by 私立さくらんぼ乳学校.
