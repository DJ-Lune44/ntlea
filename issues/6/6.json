    "Description": "windows 7x64 here:\r\n\r\n- Ntleas disappears from the context menu after reboot, perhaps this can help solving the issue http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php/82164-Right-Click-Context-Menu-for-Applocale\r\n\r\n- Ntleas does not work with AlphaRom crack, for example this game http://www.anime-sharing.com/forum/torrents-47/5-%5B140523%5D-%5Btinkerbell%5D-新しいフォ淑母の疼き-～人妻、未亡人の熟れた身体と甘い吐息～-%5Bh-game%5D-230342/ can not be run with Ntleas\r\n\r\nAlso a suggestion of mine is to allow the drag and drop of shortcuts to Ntleas instead of only the original EXE file.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
